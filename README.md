### Student Name: Valentina Jurado

Hello, my name is Valentina, I'm currently seventeen years old and my favorite things to do on my free time is watching movies and liestening to music. I enjoy my time at school because I get to hang out with my friends and even though classes sometimes may be a bit boring, I try to do my best and pay attention to what the teachers say.
