### Student Name: Ariel Icaza 
My name is Ariel, and I’m 17 years old. I’ve always been passionate about the ocean and everything that comes with it. The beach is like my second home, and there’s something so peaceful about the sound of the waves and the feeling of sand between your toes.

One of my biggest interests is marine biology. I’m fascinated by the creatures that live beneath the surface and how the entire ecosystem works together to maintain balance. I dream of one day working with marine life, whether it's through research or conservation.

I also really want to learn how to surf! I’ve always admired surfers and how they interact with the waves, so that’s definitely on my list of things to do.

Besides the ocean, I love spending time with animals. Whether it's pets, wild animals, or marine life, they have a special place in my heart.

But, when it comes down to it, I’m all about having fun and enjoying life with my friends. Whether it’s hanging out at the beach, playing sports, or just chilling, good vibes and laughter are what I live for.

So, that’s a little bit about me.
